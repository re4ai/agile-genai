RE4AI-001,Buyer Flow E2E Testing,Testing,completed,high,Claude,2026-01-14,4,100,,"Complete: Buyer login works via dev-login API. Property Finder canvas loads with 4 default properties. Search filters functional (countries/cities/types/price). Order Fractions button sends message to AI. Payment canvas has 3 methods (Card/Wire/Escrow) + tax forms. Issue: streamMessage function error during search - needs backend fix."

RE4AI-005,Fix Thread API Mock to Firestore,Backend,completed,high,Claude,2026-01-02,2,100,,"FIXED: Thread API now uses Firestore via firebase-admin. Routes updated: POST /api/threads creates in Firestore with userId. GET /api/threads returns user's threads. GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/threads/[threadId] now read/write from Firestore with auth + ownership verification. Added ThreadData interface to firestore.ts for type safety."
RE4AI-006,Add Server Health Check Endpoint,Backend,completed,medium,Claude,2026-01-02,1,100,,"FIXED: Created /api/health/route.ts endpoint.

Thread created. Tested all 4 verification steps. FINDINGS: 1) Chat input positioned 15px below viewport on all verification pages (Y=735, viewport=720). 2) Identity verification AI extraction works correctly - parsed name/address from natural language. 3) Document Signing canvas shows Prepare Documents button. 4) Flow navigation bar works (Step 1-4). Created issues RE4AI-009 through RE4AI-012."

Progress updates to 2/3 items. 2) Document Signing: Shows proper DocuSign canvas with Prepare Documents button. 3) Flow Navigation: All 4 steps visible and navigable. 4) Canvas UI: Required Information panel updates with green checkmarks when data provided."

RE4AI-012,Seller Flow E2E - Prepare Documents Spinner,Testing,completed,high,Claude,2026-01-02,1,100,,"E2E Playwright test for seller verification using seller@re4ai.com. RESULTS: Login SUCCESS | Start Listing creates thread (AXUJ54pGFf6Z2EyeIccA) | All 4 verification steps load | Identity canvas shows Step 3/4 with Required Information form | Document Signing shows Prepare Documents button. BUG FOUND: Prepare Documents spinner appears (at 1ms) but NEVER COMPLETES (>15s). Button changes to 'Preparing Documents...' with spinner but does not finish. Likely backend issue in document generation. NAVIGATION: Steps do NOT auto-advance - uses direct URL navigation (no Next button). Screenshots: /Users/m/Pictures/re4ai-e2e-screenshots/"
RE4AI-013,Fix Prepare Documents Spinner Stuck,Backend,completed,high,Claude,2026-01-02,4,100,RE4AI-012,"FIXED: DocumentSigningCanvas now uses streamMessage from GraphContext instead of just adding message to Firestore. Added 30s timeout mechanism + proper timeout clearing on response. Uses graphData.streamMessage for correct TypeScript typing. Canvas now properly integrates with streaming infrastructure for agent communication."
RE4AI-014,Seller Verification E2E - Algae Otter Password Login,Testing,completed,high,Claude,2026-01-02,2,100,,"COMPLETE: Ran Playwright E2E test for seller verification flow. ISSUES FOUND: 1) Algae Otter user was created via Google OAuth - NO password in emulator state. FIXED: Added password to emulator-data/auth_export/accounts.json. 2) Password login via auth emulator REST API works (verified with curl). 3) Next.js webpack crash FIXED by adding 'uuid' to transpilePackages. 4) Login form fills correctly but Firebase client signInWithEmailAndPassword not redirecting - possible auth state listener issue or Fast Refresh interruption. SCREENSHOTS: e2e-screenshots/"
RE4AI-015,Next.js Webpack Crash - BlockNote UUID,DevOps,completed,critical,Claude,2026-01-02,2,100,,"FIXED: Added 'uuid' to transpilePackages in next.config.js. Root cause was @blocknote/core has its own node_modules/uuid which wasn't being transpiled. Config now: transpilePackages: ['@blocknote/core', '@blocknote/react', '@blocknote/shadcn', 'uuid']. Server now stable."
RE4AI-016,Login Form Not Redirecting After Success,Frontend,completed,high,Claude,2026-01-02,2,100,RE4AI-014,"FIXED: Login.tsx now uses observeAuthState listener + isLoggingIn state to handle redirect. Added performRedirect helper using window.location.href for reliable navigation. Auth state changes trigger redirect via useEffect. Added 1s fallback timeout after successful login. Console logging added for debugging. Addresses race condition between router.replace and auth state updates."

RE4AI-019,Fix Chat Input Below Viewport,Frontend,completed,high,Claude,2026-01-02,1,100,RE4AI-018,"FIXED: Changed h-screen to h-full in canvas.tsx (3 places: ResizablePanelGroup line 128, ResizablePanel line 175, loading div line 121). Root cause: canvas.tsx used h-screen (100vh) but was nested inside a flex container with FlowNavigationBar, causing ~70-80px overflow. All 4 verification pages (lawyer/property/bank/document-signing) share same fix."
RE4AI-020,Fix Verification Status Not Syncing to Flow Dashboard,Backend,completed,high,Claude,2026-01-02,2,100,RE4AI-019,"FIXED: Two issues resolved. 1) initializeFlowStep was returning early for existing threads without updating flowContext - now it creates/updates flow_progress and updates the thread's flowContext.progressId and flowContext.taskId for existing threads. 2) All 4 verification canvases (LawyerVerificationCanvas, PropertyVerificationCanvas, BankVerificationCanvas, DocumentSigningCanvas) now read flowContext from thread document and call completeFlowTask cloud function when verification completes. This updates flow_progress collection so the seller flow dashboard reflects completed steps."
